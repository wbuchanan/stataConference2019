# 2019 Stata North American Users Group Conference
Slide deck for my talk at the conference __Barrel-aged software development: brewscheme as a four-year-old__.

## Abstract
The term "software development" implies some type of change over time. While Stata goes through extraordinary steps to support backward compatibility, user-contributors may not always see a need to continue developing programs shared with the community.
How do you know if or when you should add additional programs or functionality to an existing package? Is it easy and practical to extend existing Stata code, or is it easier to refactor everything from the ground up? What can you do to make it easier to extend existing code? While brewscheme may have started as a relatively simple package with a couple of commands and limited functionality, in the four years since it was introduced, it has grown into a multifunctional library of tools to make it easier to create customized visualizations in Stata while being mindful of color sight impairments. I will share my experience, what I have learned, and strategies related to how I dealt with these questions in the context of the development of the brewscheme package. I will also show what the additional features do that the original brewscheme did not do.
